# Loading from Excel

The NLP manager can load all the information from an excel file.
You can find an example excel file at https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js/blob/master/test/nlp/rules.xls
Inside the excel there must exists 4 tables: Languages, Named Entities, Intents and Responses. It's very important to keep the existing format of the tables: first row is the name of the table, second row are the column names, next rows are the da.
