"NLP.js" is a general natural language utilities for nodejs. Currently supporting:

- Guess the language of a phrase
- Fast levenshtein distance of two strings
- Search the best substring of a string with less levenshtein distance to a given pattern.
- Get stemmers and tokenizers for several languages.
- Sentiment Analysis for phrases (with negation support).
- Named Entity Recognition and management, multilanguage, and accepting similar strings, so the introduced text does not need to be exact.
- Natural Language Processing Classifier, to classify utterance into intents.
- Natural Language Generation Manager, so from intents and conditions it can generate an answer.
- NLP Manager: a tool able to manage several languages, the Named Entities for each language, the utterance and intents for the training of the classifier, and for a given utterance return the entity extraction, the intent classification and the sentiment analysis. Also, it is able to maintain a Natural Language Generation Manager for the answers.
- 27 languages supported: Arabic (ar), Armenian (hy), Basque (eu), Catala (ca), Chinese (zh), Czech (cs), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English (en), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), German (de), Hungarian (hu), Indonesian (id), Irish (ga), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Norwegian (no), Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), Russian (ru), Slovene (sl), Spanish (es), Swedish (sv), Tamil (ta), Turkish (tr)

## Installation

If you're looking to use NLP.js in your node application, you can install via NPM like so:

```bash
    npm install node-nlp
```

## Example of use

You can see a great example of use at the folder [`/examples/console-bot`](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js/tree/master/examples/console-bot). This example is able to train the bot and save the model to a file, so when the bot is started again, the model is loaded instead of trained again.

You can start to build your NLP from scratch with few lines:

```javascript
const { NlpManager } = require('node-nlp');

const manager = new NlpManager({ languages: ['en'] });
// Adds the utterances and intents for the NLP
manager.addDocument('en', 'goodbye for now', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'bye bye take care', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'okay see you later', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'bye for now', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'i must go', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'hello', 'greetings.hello');
manager.addDocument('en', 'hi', 'greetings.hello');
manager.addDocument('en', 'howdy', 'greetings.hello');

// Train also the NLG
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.bye', 'Till next time');
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.bye', 'see you soon!');
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.hello', 'Hey there!');
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.hello', 'Greetings!');

// Train and save the model.
(async() => {
    await manager.train();
    manager.save();
    manager.process('en', 'I have to go').then(console.log);
})();
```

This will show this result in console:

```bash
{ locale: 'en',
  localeIso2: 'en',
  language: 'English',
  utterance: 'I have to go',
  classification:
   [ { label: 'greetings.bye', value: 0.9791293407583773 },
     { label: 'greetings.hello', value: 0.020870659241622735 } ],
  intent: 'greetings.bye',
  score: 0.9791293407583773,
  entities: [],
  sentiment:
   { score: 0.5,
     comparative: 0.125,
     vote: 'positive',
     numWords: 4,
     numHits: 1,
     type: 'senticon',
     language: 'en' },
  answer: 'Till next time' }
```
